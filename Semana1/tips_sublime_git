GITHUB BASICS
----------------

git init
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "username@xyz.com"
git clone "https://git.../repositoryName.git

echo "#random shit" >> README.md  --> adds text inside "" in the file
cat README.md --> console.logs out the contents
touch .gitignore --> creates gitignore to ignore random shit files
gedit .gitignore --> opens the file with the text editor (or pico for console editing)
	randome lines -> ctrl+X to save -> y for yes -> enter for exit

git add all(or xyz.html readme.md .gitignore ...) ---> add all or selected files in the local git repository
git commit -m "first commit" --> commits all changes we made earlier in files in staging area of local repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/bijay007/**repoName**  --> add remote git repo location (shows location for pushing files)
git push -u origin master  --> push the commits on local branch repo to remote repo (*** if it shows error try below before )
** git pull origin master ** --> merges the remote(origin) with local(master) and then you can push (maybe its needed for first time pushing not sure)
git status --> making sure all is nice and smooth
git log --> to see the history of commits

------------------
/// Now suppose I made some changes on the file xyz.html //

git add xyz.html --> adds the new modified version to staging area
git commit -m "added extra edits" --> commit the changes on local repo (from staging area)
git push -u origin master --> pushes the commited file on master(branch on local repo) to origin(remote)

// better defined version here (added first day of bootcamp)

git init  – (initialize a folder to act as git repository – git watches changes in the files)
git status – (checks the changes in files)
git add <filename> or * – (things that you have modified and want to commit)
git commit -m “message” – (commits everything that are in staging area)
git log – (watches all changes made)
