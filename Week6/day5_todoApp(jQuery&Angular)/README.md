# TO-DO App using an API

Create a server that "serves" a client (under the `public` folder) that: 

- interacts with this server by using the different endopoints
- manage the creation, update, removal of tasks
- show different list tasks (done & pending tasks)

Feel free to use your own design and client app routes 

##Â Start server

To start the server you can just do

```
npm start
```

This will server static files under `public` folder and will listen to several endopoint to allow clients interact w/ the data

You can see the current status of your data all the time at `data/db.json`

## Actions available

All these endpoints will start locally w/ `http://localhost:3000` 

Example: `http://localhost:3000/api/Todos`

curl http://localhost:3000/api/Todos
```
